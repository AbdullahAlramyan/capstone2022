### Attachments Generator Tasks
* Attachment Generator should add a job type to all future jobs and future proof dockets documents and comments and the new job type called attachments
* Generate attachment jobs
* When jobs generate they also need to generate the attachments

## Redis
* Redis in new docker container will point to port 6379
* attachment_generator mapped to port 6379 in order to interact with the redis DB


## COLEMAN IDEA
- add another dockercontainer to the system that will encapsulate that little script 
- done in PR add DC
- IDEA: make container then gets launched normal with devup
- could be a standalone script and i beleive in the docker compsoe file we expose the port for docker 
- 6379 if you do a devup if you have it installed on your machine the redis port will be mapped from the redis port to the local host
- attachments generator
- attachment generator to port 6379 mapped to 6379

TODO: understand how docker will work without work generator
TODO: for the URL wants the actually URL for the main job_type except for attachments.
TODO: make sure that we have one of each jobtype downloading for the demo
