The OCC \ninterprets this notice provision as requiring the bank to withdraw an \naccount within the prior notice period or, if permissible under the \nCIF's written plan, within one year after prior notice was required \n(standard withdrawal period). The OCC is issuing an interim final rule \nto codify the standard withdrawal period and create a limited exception \nthat allows a bank, with OCC approval, to withdraw an account from the \nCIF up to one year beyond the standard withdrawal period, with \nopportunities for further extensions, provided that certain conditions \nare satisfied. The exception is intended to enable a bank to preserve \nthe value of the CIF's assets for the benefit of fund participants \nduring unanticipated and severe market conditions, such as those \nresulting from the current national health emergency concerning the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak.", "docketId": "OCC-2020-0031", "documentType": "Rule", "effectiveDate": null, "email": null, "exhibitLocation": null, "exhibitType": null, "fax": null, "field1": null, "field2": null, "fileFormats": [{"fileUrl": "https://downloads.regulations.gov/OCC-2020-0031-0001/content.pdf", "format": "pdf", "size": 297788}, {"fileUrl": "https://downloads.regulations.gov/OCC-2020-0031-0001/content.htm", "format": "htm", "size": 34089}], "firstName": null, "frDocNum": "2020-17322", "frVolNum": null, "govAgency": null, "govAgencyType": null, "implementationDate": null, "lastName": null, "legacyId": null, "media": null, "modifyDate": "2020-11-24T02:01:59Z", "objectId": "09000064847fa032", "ombApproval": null, "openForComment": false, "organization": null, "originalDocumentId": "OCC_FRDOC_0001-0321", "pageCount": 0, "paperLength": 0, "paperWidth": 0, "phone": null, "postedDate": "2020-08-13T04:00:00Z", "postmarkDate": null, "reasonWithdrawn": null, "receiveDate": "2020-08-13T04:00:00Z", "regWriterInstruction": null, "restrictReason": null, "restrictReasonType": null, "sourceCitation": null, "startEndPage": "49229 - 49233", "stateProvinceRegion": null, "subject": null, "submitterRep": null, "submitterRepAddress": null, "submitterRepCityState": null, "subtype": "Interim Final Rule", "title": "Collective Investment Funds: Prior Notice Period for Withdrawals", "topics": ["Estates", "Investments", "National Banks", "Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements", "Trusts and Trustees"], "trackingNbr": null, "withdrawn": false, "zip": null}, "id": "OCC-2020-0031-0001", "links": {"self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/documents/OCC-2020-0031-0001"}, "relationships": {"attachments": {"links": {"related": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/documents/OCC-2020-0031-0001/attachments", "self": "https://api.regulations.gov/v4/documents/OCC-2020-0031-0001/relationships/attachments"}}}, "type": "documents"}}
