# Dashboard Documentation

### Format & Server Overview

The main source of communication will come from a Flask server that contains two endpoints: `data` and `dashboard`. The server will serve JSON.

The dashboard itself will show the number of jobs in the queue, the number of jobs in progress, and the number of completed jobs. It will also display the percentage of each category as well. This front-end will be made of HTML and Javascript.
